# star_vault_front_end

Pitch:

I am creating a website for amateur astronomers to be able to browse current information of several major star systems and their attributes including distance from earth in light-years, star size, temperature in Kelvin, and the constellation in which they can be found. If an astonomer would like to share a newly-discovered star system they have found, they can upload as much (or as little) information about that star as they can. Ideally, site administrators would be experienced astronomers capable of reviewing and confirming/denying the submissions. With enough correct data submitted, non-administrators can earn "discovery points" to qualify as confirmers and/or denyers of each submission. For this project, all users have been granted special access to administrator-level privilages of non only submitting new stars, but deleting them from the database as well! 

User Stories: As a user....

1. I should be able to view a database comprising of several already discovered star systems (real data) and their respective attributes
2. I should be able to add a newly discovered star system to the database using the form provided
3. I should be able to delete bad or otherwise incorrect data from the database
